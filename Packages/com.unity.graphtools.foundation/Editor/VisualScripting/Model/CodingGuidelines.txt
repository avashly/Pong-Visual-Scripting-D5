                            CODING GUIDELINES
=========================================================================

ACTIONS
- Action name should follow the pattern:
    <Verb><Target><Modifier(if needed)>Action
- Action should be as reusable as possible, without making them cumbersome.
- Always use the following verbs if they match your action
    - 'Create'
        An action that creates a totally new object.
    - 'Delete'
        An action that totally destroys an existing object.
    - 'Add'
        An action that adds an already existing object to another existing object.
    - 'Remove'
        An action that removes an already existing object from another existing object, without destroying any of those
        objects
    - 'Move'
        An action that changes the spatial coordinate of an object.
    - 'Set'
        Assign a value

REDUCERS
- Reducer name should follow the pattern:
    Same name as the Action, without the 'Action' suffix.
- When possible, a reducer should call a method of the matching name on the model.
